I am planning to replicate a paper by Michael Findley, James Piazza, and Joseph Young titled "Games Rivals Play: Terrorism in International Rivalries," appearing in The Journal of Politics, Vol. 74, No. 1, January 2012, Pp. 235-248. This paper analyzes transnational terrorism as a component of interstate rivalries, specifically focusing on the use of terrorism in proxy warfighting. 

Replication materials are available <a href = "http://journals.cambridge.org/jop">here</a>. My thanks go to Professor Erica Chennoweth for suggesting this paper.
